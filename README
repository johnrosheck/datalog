Overview
--------

This software package contains various programs and scripts that can be
used to construct a fully functional data logging system with a web
interface for monitoring.

This system consists of three major functional parts:
1. Data acquisition programs - reads raw data from a some port then
   converts it and applies calibration information.  It then stores this
   information in an easily readable date coded file.  Any programs filling
   this need are located under the interface directory.
2. Data presentation program - follows the incoming data file from a
   particular port and loads a round-robin database (specifically rrdtool)
   specially formatted for rapid graphing.  It also generates small graphs
   so that they are always up to date.  This program is found under the
   datalog directory.
3. Web interface - consists of a main data logging index file which will
   show the latest readings in a table along with the current day and week
   graph.  Historical weekly data graphs are viewable from a link on that page.
   Each of the historical graphs can be clicked on to produce a large graph
   and drill into each day's data with a click on the data for that day.


Installation
------------

The data flow through this software starts at a specific port that can
gather multiple channels of data.  This data is continuously recorded
in a round-robin database.  After that, it can be displayed graphically
in multiple ways.

The software expects to be untarred in the base directory of a normal 
apache web server directory tree.  That is, the one containing the html
and cgi-bin directories.  By default, this system expects to be located
in the directory /home/web and this path is used throughout and 
the name 'dl' (datalog) is used as a prefix to several data and log files.

A signicant portion of all the scripts will need to be modified to fit the
system this is installed on.  Details of the file changes required can be
found in the INSTALL file.

Usage
-----

This system is complete and should be able to start up whenever the system
comes up using the scripts provided.  Multiple file changes are required
to use more than one data source.  These details are outlined in the INSTALL
documentation.

This software package contains various programs and scripts that can be
used to construct a fully functional data logging system with a web
interface for monitoring.

  Notes:
  1. Any interface program will take over its specified port.  Any other
     program needing to use that port to load and run a program on the
     remote system will need to do so before it starts.  The interface
     programs will align to the incoming stream by waiting for a newline
     before starting to process data.

  2. The base system will be continually searching for a /dev/sda.  If it
     finds one, it will partition it and put everything in partition 1
     then expand the root file system into it.  Once done, all the 
     associated files to mount it as root will be made.  Upon the next
     reboot, the system will expect to put root on that drive.
