Now called axon, was new_comm, originally pu_comm

axon provides the linkage from the standard linux console I/O and/or
stdio to a remote microprocessor running a monitor program.  The big
addition of this package is the ability to run completely in batch mode
with stdio interfaces to other processes.  The program download and
execution will be the biggest part of this.

Example command line :

$ axon -l logfile -p microprogram -x datalogger_program -n -dN /dev/ttyS0

means :
  -l = log interaction to file called 'logfile'
  -p = download and execute program 'microprogram' to remote microprocessor
  -x = after program is executed, execute 'datalogger_program' and pass
       stdio to it from the serial connection to the remote microprocessor
  -n = go into the background and send programs stdio to the bit bucket
  -dN = print more information to the logging file (at level N)
  /dev/ttyS0 = serial port to use (always specified)
